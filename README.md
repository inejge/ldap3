# LDAP client library

A pure-Rust LDAP client library using the Tokio stack.

### Version note

This is a bug-fix release for those who prefer to use the 0.9
branch. All new development is done in 0.10.x and later. Versions
0.8.x and 0.7.x are retired and no longer maintained.

### Documentation

- [Version 0.9.x](https://docs.rs/ldap3/0.9.4/ldap3/)

### Note

The library is client-only. One cannot make an LDAP server or a proxy with it.
It supports only version 3 of the protocol over connection-oriented transports.

## Usage

The library can be used either synchronously or asynchronously. The aim is to
offer essentially the same call interface for both flavors, with the necessary
differences in interaction and return values according to the nature of I/O.

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies.ldap3]
version = "0.9"
```

## Examples

The following two examples perform exactly the same operation and should produce identical
results. They should be run against the example server in the `data` subdirectory of the crate source.
Other sample programs expecting the same server setup can be found in the `examples` subdirectory.

### Synchronous search

```rust
use ldap3::{LdapConn, Scope, SearchEntry};
use ldap3::result::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut ldap = LdapConn::new("ldap://localhost:2389")?;
    let (rs, _res) = ldap.search(
        "ou=Places,dc=example,dc=org",
        Scope::Subtree,
        "(&(objectClass=locality)(l=ma*))",
        vec!["l"]
    )?.success()?;
    for entry in rs {
        println!("{:?}", SearchEntry::construct(entry));
    }
    Ok(ldap.unbind()?)
}
```

### Asynchronous search

```rust
use ldap3::{LdapConnAsync, Scope, SearchEntry};
use ldap3::result::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let (conn, mut ldap) = LdapConnAsync::new("ldap://localhost:2389").await?;
    ldap3::drive!(conn);
    let (rs, _res) = ldap.search(
        "ou=Places,dc=example,dc=org",
        Scope::Subtree,
        "(&(objectClass=locality)(l=ma*))",
        vec!["l"]
    ).await?.success()?;
    for entry in rs {
        println!("{:?}", SearchEntry::construct(entry));
    }
    Ok(ldap.unbind().await?)
}
```

## Compile-time features

The following features are available at compile time:

* __sync__ (enabled by default): Synchronous API support.

* __tls__ (enabled by default): TLS support, backed by the `native-tls` crate, which uses
 a platform-specific TLS backend. This is an alias for __tls-native__.

* __tls-rustls__ (disabled by default): TLS support, backed by the Rustls library.

Without any features, only plain TCP connections (and Unix domain sockets on Unix-like
platforms) are available. For TLS support, __tls__ and __tls-rustls__ are mutually
exclusive: choosing both will produce a compile-time error.
